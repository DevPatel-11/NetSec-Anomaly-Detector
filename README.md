# ðŸš€ NetSec Anomaly Detector  

NetSec Anomaly Detector is a cybersecurity project that leverages machine learning to detect anomalies in network traffic. With the increasing risk of cyber threats, early detection of unusual behavior in network logs is crucial for preventing attacks.  

This project uses **unsupervised learning models** like **Isolation Forest** and **Autoencoders** to flag suspicious activity in datasets such as **NSL-KDD** and **UNSW-NB15**.  

## ðŸ”¥ Features  
âœ… **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning, encoding, and normalizing network traffic logs.  
âœ… **Anomaly Detection Models** â€“ Implementation of ML techniques for intrusion detection.  
âœ… **Performance Evaluation** â€“ Using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to measure model effectiveness.  
âœ… **Real-Time Anomaly Simulation** â€“ Capturing live packets and visualizing anomalies using Python.  

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements  
- Deployment as a real-time **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.  
- Web-based security tool for live anomaly monitoring.  

## ðŸ”— Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **Matplotlib**, **Scapy**
